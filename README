Grail42 Templates is a subproject of the Grail42 project located at:

https://github.com/JoshHeitzman/grail42

This subproject currently contains the example code projects listed below and 
the Python script clonetree.py that can clone projects and files and make the
necessary token replacements as directed by the user.

CLONETREE.PY

    Clones an annotated project making token replacements as directed.
    
    clonetree.py target
    
    target       The root directory of the project to clone.
    
    The destination will be a new subdirectory created in the current workding 
    directory.
    
    For example:
    %grail_python2_x_exe% clonetree.py %grail42_root%\templates\examples\projects\hello_world_console
    
Unit Test

  Demonstrates a skeletal unit test project targeting Android NDK, the Chrome Native Client SDK, 
  and the Windows SDK all the same Visual Studio 2010 project.  Both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms 
  are supported for Windows and Chrome Native Client (NaCl).  Makes use of libraries and tools
  supplied by the the Grail42 Core sibling project (see the Grail42 project referenced above).

Hello World Console

  Demonstrates targeting the Android NDK, the Chrome Native Client SDK, and the 
  Windows SDK all from the same Visual Studio 2010 project.  Both 32-bit and 
  64-bit platforms are supported for Windows and Chrome Native Client (NaCl).
  
  Also demonstrates creating a faux console app for Android that allows the apps 
  stdout to be easily emitted in a Windows command prompt via the batch file 
  %grail42_core_cmd%\android\faux_console\run_app.cmd supplied by the Grail42 
  Core sibling project (see the Grail42 project referenced above).
  
  The NaCl platform is configured by default to run from the standalone 
  commandline tool sel_ldr*.exe rather than from Chrome to provide a consistent 
  console experience.  When run in Chrome, the project demonstrates doing so 
  as a faux console app that allows the plug-ins stdout to be easily emitted 
  in a Windows command prompt via the batch file that also starts and stops 
  the necessary simple web server.  The batch file is supplied by the Grail42 
  Core project at %grail42_core_cmd%\nacl\faux_console\run_nexe_in_chrome.cmd 
  and %grail42_core_cmd%\nacl\run_nexe_standalone.cmd providesa convienence 
  batch file o run the plug-in standalone in sel_ldr*.exe
